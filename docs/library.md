title: Jericho's Library

# Jericho's Library
A general resources page of various topics.  
Jericho's Library is the new, permanent home of my resources page, which was present on my site (and prior, on my SpaceHey) for approximately two years.
This page is mostly inspired by FMHY, with a bit of redundant resources removed every once and a while, or an occasional site that I like, that nobody's ever talked about.  

This page does not include anything listed in our game guides, as that's not its purpose. You should still read the main pages if something interests you.

# Guide

### Remote Control
::: warning
***NEVER*** install a remote control software if instructed by another user, especially if it's to "clean" your computer of viruses. The caller on the other end will just steal and delete all of your files.  
You should only need a software of this kind if you want to access one of your devices from another device, or you need to perform tech tasks over the internet that need some help from a nerd.
