# Jericho's Library
A general resources page of various topics.  
Jericho's Library is the new, permanent home of my resources page, which was present on my site (and prior, on my SpaceHey) for approximately two years.
This page is mostly inspired by FMHY, with a bit of redundant resources removed every once and a while, or an occasional site that I like, that nobody's ever talked about.  

This page does not include anything listed in our game guides, as that's not its purpose. You should still read the main pages if something interests you.

# Guide
| Icon | Meaning |

### Remote Control
::: warning
Never install a remote control software if asked by another user, especially if it's to "remove" a virus. The caller on the other end will just steal and delete all of your files.

You should only install a remote control program if you need to access your computer from another device, or need to perform some technical help over the internet with a friend you trust.

### Web Browsing
#### Browsers
::: warning
Manifest V2 will be deprecated upon the release of Chrome 129 on August 4th. Chromium browsers are not eligible for being listed at this time.

We'll wait and see what happens to Manifest V2 support by all the most popular browsers, including some previously listed options.
:::

::: danger
Chromium based browsers, when paired with uBlock Origin, usually have poor adblocking due to the fact that ads cannot be blocked **before** the page loads. If you need serious adblocking, tend to misclick on pages a lot, or just generally hate ads, consider a Firefox/Gecko based option.
:::

- üèÜ **[Firefox](https://www.firefox.com)** - Gecko
- ‚≠ê **[Floorp](https://floorp.app)** - Gecko / Use Floorp 11 for Themes
- **[Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app/)** - Gecko / **[Code Snippets](https://zen-browser.app/mods/)**

#### Firefox Themes
::: warning
All themes here require manual install that may be confusing to some users.
