# DJSng's Toolkit

A more personalized approach on some resource pages. Mainly based on a bunch of stuff I already play, backed by personal experience. Inspired by many pre-existing projects, such as TheUsefulLists and FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH.  

## Why?

Why the fuck not? Many people on Neocities already make their own lists of resources and I wanted to do that too. With a bit of fancy in it!  
As for every single section, it varies. I found TUL's Minecraft resources to be very cool and helpful most of the time, but wanted to make something similiar to it that focuses more heavily on notes.

# Disclaimer
Mods and other featured tools are tested to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, I try my best to check mods myself before adding them to this repo. I cannot be held responsibile if you are infected with anything on this list, I cannot check every single update manually. You should check mods on your own time using provided file hashes, extracting the file contents, or whatever means you see fit.
