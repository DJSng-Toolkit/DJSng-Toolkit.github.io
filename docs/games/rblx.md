# ROBLOX

A bunch of fan utilities for ROBLOX.  

::: warning
90% of flags are snake oil and may not make a difference. Worst case scenario, it might actually make your performance **worse**.  
If you ever have issues with your game that causes UI bugs or otherwise has disabled features that used to work, the first thing you should do is disable all of your custom flags and use your launcher's built-in option to not apply modifications on next launch.  

Remember to also tell your launcher to completely reinstall ROBLOX.  
:::

::: warning
ROBLOX plans to remove FastFlags soon due to user abuse. These flags may stop working at any time.  
Toolkit is not a FastFlag guide.

## Old ROBLOX
Assume all revivals here are for Windows only.  
All revivals here are mainly launchers. Due to the complications of Website launchers, as well as my own limited experience, there will be almost no website revivals here.  

Be careful what you install.
