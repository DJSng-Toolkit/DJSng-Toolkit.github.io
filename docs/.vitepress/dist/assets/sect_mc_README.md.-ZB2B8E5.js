There&#39;s many choices, with TheUsefulLists being a general &quot;go-to&quot; and a lot of TUL inspired lists covering their tracks.<br> However, I also wanted to take a shot. I struggle a lot with my own notes, and I&#39;ve had my fair share of modding oppertunities where I just completely forgot some mods are incompatible. Plus, I play with a lot of scenario specific mods and find out about incompatibilities from mod developers that I don&#39;t find out until last minute. So, I wanted to make a TheUsefulLists adjacent project with a bit more documentation.<br> And then Toolkit was born.</p><h1 id="disclaimer" tabindex="-1">Disclaimer <a class="header-anchor" href="#disclaimer" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Disclaimer&quot;">â€‹</a></h1><p>Mods are tested to the best of my ability to ensure that they are not malicious or infected, I try my best to check mods myself before adding them to this repo.
