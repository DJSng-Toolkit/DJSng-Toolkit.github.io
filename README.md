# DJSng's Toolkit
A FMHY-like index of resources for video games and software.  
Created by a casual, for casuals.

Inspired by [TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) and [FMHY](https://fmhy.net) (but not affiliated or endorsed by either), DJSng's Toolkit is a collection of resources I've gathered over the years, mainly being Gaming focused, but also including Software and other notes I've kept in the back of my mind.  
**This guide assumes you know how to do very basic modding** (i.e: reading a mod page, installing a mod in any way). You do not need experience. If you know how to install a mod, either manually or with a mod manager, you already know most of what you need to know to start.

Please keep in mind that I am a one person team, so all information may be outdated or lacking at times. I'm trying my hardest to stay up to date.

This bundle of resources is inspired by many projects and community made resources, including:
* Various Neocities users' Resource Pages
* FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH
* TheUsefulLists
* "Awesome" list projects on GitHub
* ...and many more!
